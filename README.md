# American-Sign-Language-ASL-Gesture-Recognition
Built and trained three deep learning models with different architectures and parameters. The training dataset contains 87,000 images. Developed a full-stack website that offers real-time ASL gesture recognition, dynamically displays the recognized signs as text, and integrates a Text-to-Speech API to verbalize the text.
